To Do:

    Add libs required in ReadMe
    PR workflow with ZenHub
    Contact etho
        Make twitter and update it
    Add all the below to issue tracker (keeping the issue tracker organized with labels and milestones as well)
    Add issue of public To Do as a checklist on Github
        Can get comments on it, more public opinion, and then I can just update the original one
        Why not make it visible?
            Will force me to stay on top of it and keep it organized with subsections
        Tricky ones can be broken up into separate issues with a link to them
    Set up PR template
    Template for features: "I want <some feature> so that <some benefit>"
    Refactor ReadME to include description of product (existing) and new section on issues/issue management/planning
    Monthly update from user perspective (i.e. reddit imgur album/gif)
    More testing (in general) needed, how to do so...

    Tick upgrade
    Make it so that void upgrade works only when full, or keeps a stack or something

    JEI-book on first backpack crafted, just nice formatting
        Or point to JEI resource tab on first backpack opened
    Restocking upgrade doesn't allow placing other items on other ones (as it overrides shift click),

    BetterBuildersWands breaks if >=64 blocks placed at once

    PR for onBlockPlaced.Post
        gr8pefish> Hey mezz, so the BlockEvent.PlaceEvent's itemInHand variable (the item you use to place a block) has the information of the stack before the block is placed. So, for example, if you are holding 64 cobble and place one, the event will fire and event.getStackInHand() will return a stack of *64* cobble. I think this would be a good candidate to split into .pre and .post (or just add a .post) like other forge events.
        <gr8pefish> Specifically so I can get access to the stack after it is placed (63 cobble in this example). If I started working on a PR for this, would it have a chance of being accepted? Thanks
        <mezz> you described what happens, but I don't understand why you need it. can you explain?
        <gr8pefish> Sure.
        <Player> in 1.11 you wouldn't pass the stack to start with i guess
        <gr8pefish> Use case: Iron Backpacks has a restocking upgrade which can refill items that the player uses. One way this happens is when they place a torch, I want it to be restocked and go back up to max stack size if it can be resupplied from a store of torches in the backpacks. Other similar mods handle this via a generic tick handler, but I'm trying to make mine event based to be more resource friendly.
        * Nedelosk has quit (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
        <mezz> "Other similar mods" heh can you say Forestry
        <mezz> that makes perfect sense as an event, go for it
        <gr8pefish> Cool, thanks :) And I know of at least 1 other mod that does it with a tick handler, that's why I didn't just say foresty :P
        <gr8pefish> Should I do it as .post only, or change the existing one to .pre as well?
        <mezz> like Player said you should probably make this a breaking change and remove itemInHand, so split it into pre and post while you're at it
        <gr8pefish> Oh yeah, this is all 1.10 if it wasn't clear
        <gr8pefish> alright, will do
        <mezz> ah in 1.10 you're more limited
        <mezz> I think you should do this in 1.11
        <gr8pefish> Has forge dropped support for 1.10 yet? I agree that 1.11 would be easier, but I'd ideally like to have this change on 1.10
        <gr8pefish> and I can port it over to 1.11 later
        <mezz> they have not dropped support for 1.10. just can't make breaking changes there
        <mezz> so imo implement it on 1.10 and then add a cleaned up version for 1.11 with breaking changes
        <gr8pefish> Sure. To be clear: just add a .post for 1.10 that isn't breaking (but messier because of that), and then refactor it in 1.11 to be .pre and .post with the breaking changes?
        <mezz> adding .post is breaking mods that subscribe to the PlaceEvent
        <mezz> you'll have to make a new event like PlaceEventPost instead of subclassing PlaceEvent
        <gr8pefish> Ah, okay yeah.
        <gr8pefish> Cool, idk when I'll get around to it, but it's definitely now on my list. Thanks for the assistance/clarification! :)

    where the bag can be thrown out of the inventory and then picked back up again without closing the GUI, and the content refresh only happened after clicking on a slot.
        'q' disabled, but alt-click freezes game indefinitely (invTweaks)

    tooltips go over jei and the screen edge

    Add HUD for damage bar upgrade when equipped?

    Botania integration as well

    Make sure it works with the mods in TPPI
	    - MouseTweaks, TombManyGraves
    Clean up events (so gross in there)

    Fix ReadMe badge updating with beta/release and colors from gradle.properties (if statements/replacement needed, so gradle fancyness required)

    Add check to not allow nesting more than 1 deep (possible)?

    Make additional upgrade points be removable as well? (just spit out an upgrade if in 9th slot or something)
    recipes no longer include records (mc:item.record) :(

    integrate filter to put in ender storage pack directly
    diamond too expensive still?
    filter to accept everything picked up (blacklist/whitelist mode change)
    Implement tab system instead of shift-right click?
        Could be used for other upgrades like crafting, fluid, energy storage.
        Could make it possible to remove limit on configurable upgrades (just add 3 per tab and add multiple tabs)

    add in hq gui PR to faithful 32x? (use git to get old files)
    Add in crafting grid upgrade (but make it all sorts of expensive/takes away inventory slots/some big cost)?
        Tab system above ^

        Bugs:
            Nesting opening backpacks via right click broke from change to the event for any backpack to open via right click
                Examine code from back then versus now. May be because it is called client side only now? Nor sure.

                removeUUID
                IItemHandler

        Features:
            Disable upgrades via disable recipe and .disabled field in ItemUpgrade from config, also do JEI checks when instantiating
            Add right click ability as an upgrade
            Ender backpack
                    iron -> ender or diamond -> ender?

                    Make all backpacks place-able inworld (essentially portable chests).
                    Then I will just have the ender upgrade link two backpacks' contents together somehow (maybe the upgrade, when created, gives 2 upgrades as an output, both with a unique identifier that can then be applied to 2 separate backpacks). Then you can place one down (pseudo-chest) and walk around with the other backpack in your inventory/equipped. That way I can balance it more, as it's a part of my mod and not just linking to something else (e.g. make it cost a ton of upgrade points).
                    This is all grand and well, but is definitely not trivial to implement. I need to rewrite a bit of the mod to allow for this level of new abilities, so it's not going to happen super soon (especially with finals coming up).

                    Add ritual/something fancy to link ender backpacks together?

            Tool upgrade, slots in alt gui and then mouse wheel to rotate through them
                render on pack eventually for extra fancyness?


        QoL Changes:
           Check playthrough notes
           Config option for 32x textures (make 16x default)
           Check out Baubles compat again, has a chest slot that could be perfect (and good way to test saving)
           Change names for filters to be more player-friendly (i.e. ore dictionary?)
           Add fancy label to incr. tier recipe for showing it keeps its inventory and whatnot.

           look at Botania for tutorialIfFirstUse
               Set of GuiScreens with informational tooltips/textboxes that you click through to see all the ways to use a backpack
               Expand this idea so when you make an (i.e. AdvancedFilter) for the first item, shows popup for the nifty things for it.

           Tooltip for storage emphasis shows how much space?
               Add in description instead?

           Order tooltip for backpack upgrades alphabetically?


        Balance Tweaks:
            Differentiate between tiers more
            Harsher upgrade point limits on packs in general
            Add it so need upgrade specialization for certain upgrades?

        Visuals:
            try - reduce number of colors in sprites - look more like vanilla armor
            Fat backpack for storage emphasis, and some extra texture for upgrade emphasis?
                More definite shading for storage emphasis ones?
                Some other way to differentiate between two?
                    Clasp color?
                    Pockets/designs?
            add open/closed ones
            Different models/textures for upgrade/storage emphasis (more pockets vs bigger model)

                Add backpack tab (like TiCon)
                    Add in clickable tab with icon and tooltip (in the correct location even if TiCon, etc, is installed)

                make event upgrades not sort the backpack before doing their things!

                make the upgrades cheaper overall, introduce t1 and t2 crafting bases?

                make compression/crafting advanced filter

                some upgrade to increase storage slots?
                    rows and columns?
                    probably not

                add a way to remove additional upgrade points upgrades?

            JEI:
                 minor: tooltips have slightly lager space between first line and second, remove that


            Investigate:
                add crafttweaker support
                Send packet to client when join server to sync (metas?) configs up

                Add analytics (see bagginses / https://github.com/NPException/GameAnalyticsAPI)
                Add commands for storing/loading backpack data
                    Will involve some fileIO for NBT data, not a trivial thing
                Support Crafttweaker special recipes?

                Some super fancy intro popup that shows to a user semi-hidden features on first use (like the ability to right click backpacks inside another).

    NOW:

		
    SOON:

        GIT STUFF:

        REFACTOR:

        TESTING:


        BUGS:


        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:
            Tick Handler
                Crafting upgrade onItemPutInBackpack (so for manually putting items in)

            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?

            Have quick deposit upgrade work with equipped backpack
                use a keybinding?

            Have depth upgrade apply to the IBlockProvider --> wait for Vazkii API update

            Add ender upgrade(s)?
                depthEnder - allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
                vanillaEnder - vanilla ender chest linked backpack (with backpack able to take upgrades)
                remoteEnder - or specified filter linking to a specific chest

            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                    test this

            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

            Add Baubles integration as belt slot to equip
                config option to toggle between?
                Traveler's gear compat too

            crafting upgrade check if backpack is full (#31)
                should do a different long-term solution because you can maybe make less slots even if the backpack is full with crafting
                so a simple check for 'do all the slots have items' isn't sufficient. I should check if it has anything but a tiny crafting
                upgrade since the other two can condense item slots (assuming there is space for them to put the new items).

        EXTRA:

            Fancier config updating/replacing values
                See botania, vazkii is going to implement something similar
                    check current version somehow and compare to origin/versions.txt, if less then do something

            fancy crafting upgrade - choose 1 or 2 or 3 diameter w/ button underneath (like adv. filter)

            mining filter - change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?

            change it so an entityItem looks to fill a stack in the player's inv before going in filter?

            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably

            add in hard mode config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
                no shapeless crafting for removal of upgrades, have to use the crafted one specifically


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method
            (IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)
            4 tiers (or upgrade and drops excess items onto ground), or adds barrel slot like a DSU?

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it
