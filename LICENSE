I only ask that you don't sell it. I'm not saying you can't, I'm just asking from the deepest parts of 
my soul that you refrain from doing so. I will also tell you that everytime you sell it, a puppy sheds 
a tear and a kitten loses out on catnip. You don't want to be the cause of that, do you? :(
